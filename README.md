# Unsupervised-Chunking-NLP
This is a replication of a paper about chunking in NLP. The main algorithm is the proposed method which is a combination of Compound PCFG with HRNN. Some supervised and unsupervised chunker models are included to compare the results. More details can be found in the final report.
